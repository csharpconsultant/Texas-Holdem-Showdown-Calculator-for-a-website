# Texas-Holdem-Showdown-Calculator-for-a-website
I wrote this years ago as a quick odds calculator for up to 4 hands as well as 1 hand versus random opponents
<br/>
The original code was in ASP.NET Webforms with C#.  I upgraded to VS 2019 Community edition and for some reason the Web Forms project defaulted to VB.NET so the code behind for OddsCalc.aspx was converted using an online code converter.
<br/>
For player 1 through 4 enter a Holdem Hand with the format {Card}{Suit}{Card}{Suit}.<br/>
Big Slick would be AdKh<br/>
2 Example hands are entered by default.<br/>
Optionally you can enter 5 board cards in the same format.<br/><br/><br/>
